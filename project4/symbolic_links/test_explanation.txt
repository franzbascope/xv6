In this test we do the following steps:
1. Create a file at test_folder/file.txt with content: Hello, World!
2. Create symlink "symbolic_link" that targets "test_folder/file.txt"
3. We read symlink and verify it shows the content from "test_folder/file.txt"
4. We create a hard link symbolic_link2 that points to symbolic_link,
we print the result and verified that the actual symlink was used and not the target.
5. We unlink symbolic_link, and check if test_folder/file.txt still exists,
this proves that the unlink sys call does not follow the sym link.
